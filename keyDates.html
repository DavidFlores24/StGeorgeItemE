            <h3>1976 - 19777</h3>
            <h4>St George’s Music Trust is born…</h4>
            <p>
            A year on from the death of the Vicar of St George’s, Canon Percy Gay, the future of the church was in doubt. In the meantime, a new home was being sought for the young musicians of the ‘Academy of the BBC’ a training orchestra which had been performing at the rather cramped Bristol Arts Centre on King’s Square. The search, by the Centre’s Vice Chairman, John Funnell, ended at St George’s when a visit with violinist David Stone discovered that the church had a rather magical acoustic.
            <br/><br/>
			John was introduced to Blanche Long, a local businesswoman, fundraiser and musician, and together they plotted an idea. With the future of the building uncertain, they glimpsed a tantalising opportunity to transform St George’s into a centre for music.  The city was lacking a medium-sized venue for classical chamber concerts and St John’s Smith Square had flourished in London -, so why shouldn’t St George’s do the same for Bristol?
         	<br/><br/>
         	In order to share the space they needed the buy-in of the church community and the diocese, so they approached the Headmaster of QEH School, Harry Edwards, who was familiar with St George’s and its Vicar. Harry was very familiar with St George’s and its Vicar; his connections and love for the building proved to be key in forging a good working relationship that would give them access to the church where they could begin making music. Harry joined Blanche and John to become the founding members of what they called ‘St George’s Music Trust’.
			<br/><br/>
			The Music Trust engaged the interest of the BBC’s music department in the summer of 1976, specifically its director Philip Moore, and a session with the Academy musicians was arranged so that they could put the acoustic through its paces. The BBC was delighted with the results and they endorsed John, Blanche and Harry’s ambitious project. The local community got behind the venture, seeing it as a means of securing the future of their beloved church; some though sawthe advancement of the Music Trust as more of a threat.
			<br/><br/>
			At 1pm on Wednesday 15 December 1976 the Music Trust presented its very first concert, by the Academy of the BBC. It was recorded and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on Tuesday 5 April 1977. Two more concerts followed, on Thursday 17 February 1977 and Friday 4 March 1977 (each recorded and broadcast), ahead of the official launch of St George’s Music Trust in May 1977.

            <h3>1980's</h3>
            <h4>St George’s Brandon Hill</h4>
            <p>Up until 1984 St George’s was still a working parish church, shared by the Music Trust for concerts. These were mostly lunchtime concerts, save for occasional special evening events. The first of these evening concerts was held on Wednesday 29 April 1981 with The English Concert and harpsichordist Trevor Pinnock. The main reason for not putting on evening concerts was the lack of facilities; there was no bar and no public toilets in the building at this time. For that first evening event, two toilets were hired from a local Disco company!
			<br/><br/>
			With the closure of the church in April 1984 it was hoped that a lease could be signed by the Music Trust quite quickly, but there were many delays and it wasn’t until September 1985 that the keys to St George’s were officially handed over to the Trust. In the meantime St George’s had been established as a company in June 1985 and ambitious plans had been devised to redevelop the building for public and artistic use. The first of the organisation’s major fundraising campaigns was launched that summer, and a vision to build a proper stage, along with public and artist facilities, was unveiled at a special Invitation Concert and Reception on Sunday 14 July 1985. Works were scheduled to take place in the summer of 1986, ahead of the venue’s relaunch.
			<br/><br/>
			The venue, by then known as St George’s Brandon Hill, continued its now nationally famous lunchtime concert programmes with the BBC through into the early 1990s, and hired out the hall for occasional evening concerts. With its new stage and some of the proposed facilities in place, it set about programming a regular series of evening concerts for the very first time, beginning on 18 October 1986 with a performance by the piano duo, Anthony Goldstone and Caroline Clemmow.
			<br/><br/>
			The mid 1980s really were a boom time for St George’s as the vision for the venue became a reality with the help of the wider board of trustees, director John Wright, later Jane Krish, and patrons such as the Duchess of Westminster. Harry and Blanche were the lifeblood of the operation; their passion, enthusiasm and unending good humour inspiring anyone who came into contact with the project. The future, while never exactly secure, was certainly bright for St George’s.

            <h3>1990's</h3>
            <h4>St George's Bristol</h4>
            <p>St George’s Brandon Hill was firmly established as one of the country’s leading concert venues for classical music as a new decade began.  Jane Krish, who began as Secretary to the Trustees in 1985 went on to become Director of the organisation, succeeded by Jonathan Stracey in February 1990. Jonathan came to St George’s from the BBC and had a keen understanding of what could be achieved in terms of recording and broadcasts at the venue. Beyond that he brought a fresh set of eyes and ears, and envisaged larger audiences and a broader range of music for St George’s.
			<br/><br/>
			To aid this new vision, further major works needed to be carried out to fulfil the earlier complete vision of the Trust. This was achieved by 1993 when the venue revealed brand new public and professional facilities. A new cafe bar and improved access for audiences was a boon for the venue, while key relationships were established with the major record labels who would take advantage of the special acoustic in the hall, and enjoy dedicated space in the crypt from which to work. Virgin, EMI, Decca, and of course the BBC, all recorded at St George’s during this time, bringing with them the cream of classical artists, all wanting to capture the St George’s sound.
			<br/><br/>
			The programme too went from strength to strength, with more jazz, folk and world music than ever before, alongside the bedrock of classical concerts, and from 1997 a fledgling education programme. Key artistic partnerships were founded at this time, with the likes of Brodsky Quartet becoming regular performers on stage – the Brodsky’s performance with Björk in 1998 remains one of the most memorable nights at St George’s. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment began a residency that endures to this day with a landmark concert in 1995.
			<br/><br/>
			Amidst so much success, there was more that needed to be done and Jonathan led his growing team through another exciting phase of redevelopment that would see the hall undergo one last transformation. In 1999 the venue was re-launched as St George’s Bristol.

            <h3>2000's - present</h3>
            <h4>Open for all...</h4>
            <p>The venue embraced the new millennium with a new name, and a strong vision for what it wanted to be, thanks in no small part to a decade of leadership by Jonathan Stracey and a passionate and dedicated staff team. The programme was as varied and rich as ever, but received a boost when Jonathan invited journalist and jazz aficionado Phil Johnson to programme a series of concerts in 2002. ‘Late Notes’ became a staple of the St George’s concert schedule, offering some of the best and most exciting jazz, folk and world music artists from Bristol, the UK and far beyond. One of the major highlights of the non-classical programme in this era was the ‘Migrations’ world music series, which began in 2009.  St George’s attracted phenomenal artists from all corners of the globe; never had the programme been so diverse and thrilling.
            <br/><br/>
			Jonathan’s time at St George’s was cut short due to ill health in 2006, and he was succeeded by Suzanne Rolt, who had been part of the team since the 1990s. Suzanne would cultivate St George's for the 21st century, ushering in some of the most ambitious and exciting plans for the organisation since its founding and taking the artistic programme to ever greater heights.
			<br/><br/>
			The education programme grew and grew during this period, with the launch of the Cosmos Choir in South Bristol, and the beginning of our popular series of family concerts, now a major award-winner.
			<br/><br/>
			Though the BBC has long since moved its music production team out of Bristol, St George’s still keeps ties with 
			Radio 3, which still broadcasts concerts from the venue. Highlights of the relationship include the week-long series’ ‘Earth Music Bristol’ (2011), ‘Bristol Baroque Festival’ (2013), and ‘Brahms Experience’ (2014), each of which saw the station ‘move in’ and broadcast from St George’s over five consecutive days.
			<br/><br/>
			In 2014 the venue launched its Building a Sound Future capital appeal with a rooftop performance by violinist Thomas Gould.  It was an auspicious start to the project, which was given a further boost by a Royal visit that same year by the Count and Countess of Wessex.
			<br/><br/>
			While the OAE celebrated 20 years of concerts at St George’s in 2015, further orchestral residences have blossomed, with London’s innovative Aurora Orchestra providing some of the most imaginative classical concerts in recent memory. In 2017 Chineke! Orchestra made its St George’s debut, the first in what looks to be yet another thrilling residency.
