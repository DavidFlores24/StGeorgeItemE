    <h3>Acoustic Testing</h3>
    <p>In 2015 ahead of submitting our applications for funding for the new extension, we asked a local company (Charcoalblue) to come in an test the acoustics. We had to be sure that the changes to the building were not going to impact how things sounded in the hall. In doing so, they actually proved what we’ve been saying for years; St George’s has a remarkable acoustic! To test the space, the team popped balloons and recorded the reverberation in the space, i.e. how long the sound lingers and how far it carries.
      <br/><br/>
      It seems that in most concert halls you would expect low pitched sound to reverberate longer than higher pitches. In St George’s, however, they found that higher frequencies dominate the acoustic response, making for a rather unique acoustic.
      <br/><br/>
      <i>“The narrow dimensions of the Georgian building, its modest size, lack of soft furnishings (leather seat-covering rather than fabric), the well-proportioned balcony, and mix of smooth walls and finely textured plasterwork are all contributing factors to this unusually rare acoustic.” </i>BRYCE HARRISON, CHARCOALBLUE
