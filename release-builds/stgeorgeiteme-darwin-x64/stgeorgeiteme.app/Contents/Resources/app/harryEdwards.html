  		<h3>Extract from a speech given by Harry Edwards in 1978</h3>
		<p>‘We must look forward not back. If St. George’s is not to be a parish church – and the ecclesiastical authorities have never been in doubt on that – then surely the finest memorial that Bristol could have to Percy Gay would be a church, preserved in excellent shape, nationally famous as a centre for first-class classical music and increasingly used. One day, if we can raise the money, we would like to have the stonework cleaned so that Bristol may see the building in its pristine beauty.
		<br/><br/>
		In his boyhood, Percy Gay was a chorister, with a love of good music. He also loved humanity with all its failings and he had such a wide appreciation of the broad spectrum of life that I think he understood how it is that some folk’s spiritual awareness may be heightened more by a Mozart quartet than by a church service. I find it difficult to believe that he would be saddened by seeing St. George’s used to the benefit of hundreds of Bristolians and through broadcasts, to millions of music lovers throughout the kingdom.’
