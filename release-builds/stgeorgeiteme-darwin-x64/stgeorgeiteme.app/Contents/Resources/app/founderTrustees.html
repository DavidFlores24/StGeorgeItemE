            <h3>Harry Edwards</h3>
            <h4>1918 - 1995</h4>
            <p>
            <i>Harry Edwards was the first Chairman of St George’s Music Trust. The former Headmaster of QEH School, Harry found a real passion project in St George’s, having known the late Canon Percy Gay well. A man of wit and zeal, Harry was a true raconteur and for many was the life and soul of St George’s in its early years. 
            <br/><br/>
            The following account of his life was written by him for an early ‘Friends of St George’s’ newsletter…</i>
			<br/><br/>
			Of your Trustees, the Chairman is the least educated in the technique of music. The grammar school which I attended in Cambridge in the 1930s was competent in many directions, but not in music. (As far as our British education system is concerned, most progress has been made in the last thirty years, I think, in the standard of musical education provided for the average pupil.) But I had the great good fortune to go to King’s College, Cambridge, when Boris Ord was the College (and University) Organist. The undergraduate Organ scholar was at first Douglas Guest, now just retiring from Westminster Abbey, then David Willcocks. So the College in general, and the Chapel and the Choir were the first major musical influences in my life.
			<br/><br/>
			The second, oddly enough, was – indirectly – the army. Of my six years, four were spent in the western half of the Mediterranean, and in the Spring of 1944, I left Algiers for Caserta, a few miles north of Naples. The energetic Brigadier in charge of the Naples area – an Old Cliftonian called B.U.S. Cripps – was the dynamic force in getting the San Carlo Opera House in Naples reopened. For five shillings a time, members of the services could see the whole repertory of Italian opera. I used to go about twice a week and I acquired a love of the art which draws me to the Hippodrome whenever the Welsh National Opera Company is here.
			<br/><br/>
			The third powerful influence was the music department of Clifton College and more specifically, the personality of the late Douglas Fox. I joined the modern languages staff in 1947, when Douglas was Director of Music. Totally untrained as I was, I managed to get into the Choral Society – less, I am sure, on merit than on Douglas’s wise policy of encouraging maximum support for music from the staff, however it was offered. The music tackled was exciting and catholic. Beethoven’s Choral Symphony – yes, Douglas actually put the last movement down a semitone to enable soloists and choral society to cope – Handel’s “Israel in Egypt” for double choir, Bach’s Matthew and John Passions, Constant Lambert’s Rio Grande, Stanford’s Songs – it was all a fine education in itself.
			<br/><br/>
			It gave me great pleasure, when I was Headmaster of Queen Elizabeth’s Hospital, to help to build up the musical life of the school, first with the enthusiasm of Peter Fowler, assisted by Malcolm Harding, and then Richard Jones. Now in “semi-retirement”, so many threads of my past have come happily together in the work of St. George’s Music Trust.

            <h3>Blanche Long</h3>
            <h4>Birth TBC - 1999</h4>
            <p>
			<i>If Harry was the life and soul of St George’s, then Blanche Long was its Heart. Warm, compassionate and endlessly generous of spirit, Blanche worked selflessly for St George’s. Her post-concert luncheons were the stuff of legend, and she was loved by all who knew her. Her friendship with Harry was close, the pair of them often to be seen out for a drive in her Rolls Royce; Harry waving regally through the passenger window. Blanche died suddenly in July 1999, not long after standing down as a Trustee, and being made the first Life President of the St George’s Music Trust which she had co-founded.
			<br/><br/>
			The following short account was featured in an early ‘Friends of St George’s’ newsletter…</i>
			<br/><br/>
			The lady at the door who so happily delights in extricating your programme money from you week by week – is also a founder member of the trust and was a professional musician.
			<br/><br/>
			Having suffered from polio, she was encouraged to study music seriously from an early age culminating in 4 years at Trinity College of Music, London, where she concentrated on piano and composition with Alec Rowley taking singing as a third subject. After college she taught in a boys prep school and did some concert work.
			<br/><br/>
			Through marriage, she came to Bristol from Wiltshire and became interested in engineering and is now a director of a small company.
			<br/><br/>
			Many of you who know Blanche will be aware of her great commitment to fund raising for the Camphill Village Trust for the mentally handicapped, which also involves her in a great deal of public speaking.
			<br/><br/>
			After hearing of Blanche’s reputation as an organiser, John Funnell invited her to help launch St George’s Music Trust and with her knowledge of music, she was able to undertake the programming of the non-BBC concerts.
			<br/><br/>
			Her enthusiasm and optimism provides St George’s Music Trust with a pillar of strength which is so essential to the future survival and prosperity of the Trust.

            <h3>John Funnel</h3>
            <h4>TBC</h4>
            <p>
            <i>John Funnell is the only surviving member of the original trio of founders. His financial and business acumen were a huge asset in the early development of St George’s, while his passion for music, and useful connections, were key to the beginning of the organisation’s story.
			<br/><br/>
			The following account was featured in an early ‘Friends of St George’s’ newsletter…</i>
			<br/><br/>
			After preparatory school in Buckinghamshire John Funnell moved with his parents to Bristol where he went to Clifton College. It was at Clifton that his interest in music was encouraged although he had always grown up with music in the home since his father has studied at the Royal Academy and had been organist at St Clement Danes in The Strand. John was a difficult pupil and in spite of he endeavours of the musical staff at Clifton, never realised his potential as a pianist. As a counter tenor he achieved notoriety at school for singing one of the solo parts in Purcell’s Come Ye Sons of Art at an end of term concert.
			<br/><br/>
			At eighteen, he went to London and served his articles with a firm of chartered accountants. Having failed to qualify for that profession he went to work in the general office of a firm of stockbrokers, from where he was to progress until he eventually became a member of the London Stock Exchange in 1969. In 1973 he left London to set up his own business as an Investment Manager in Bristol, where he became involved in the musical activities of the Bristol Arts Centre. It was the lack of suitable accommodation for music at 4-5 King Square that led him to search for a new home for the young musicians of the Academy of the BBC. After some two years or more of looking at all kinds of buildings he was introduced to St. George’s Church, Brandon Hill and saw at once its enormous potential and atmosphere. Since that occasion John has been overwhelmed by the support that the Trust has received.
