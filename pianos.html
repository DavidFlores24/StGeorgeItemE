  		<h3>The Pianos of St George's</h3>
		<p>A number of instruments have been used at St George’s over the years, indeed the church itself owned an upright piano, but this was given to St Mary’s Church in Fishponds in 1984 when the church was closed.
		<br/><br/>
		Founder trustee John Funnell brought in a Yamaha Baby Grand Piano, which was useful for schools concerts and choral accompaniment, while the BBC had brought in its own Steinway Model D Concert Grand in 1982.  The BBC Piano (as it was known) was eventually gifted to St George’s and was used for concerts and recordings right through until its retirement and sale in 2013. It was a popular instrument, though, and often requested specifically by artists over the years. 
		<br/><br/>
		Arts Council funding in 1998/9 meant St George’s was able to buy its own brand new Steinway Model D for the first time; it’s a fine instrument which the venue still uses today. It replaced the BBC Piano as the No 2 piano in 2013, following a successful ‘Grand Piano Appeal’ which saw the purchase of another brand new Steinway. The new instrument was hand picked by pianist Paul Lewis, who travelled to the Steinway factory in Hamburg with Suzanne Rolt. It took the place of the 1999 piano as the No 1 instrument on the stage at St George’s Bristol.
